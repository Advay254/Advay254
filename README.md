# 🚀 About Me
I’m **Advay** — a builder who loves designing systems that **run automatically, scale smoothly, and stay reliable without constant supervision**.

My whole mindset is simple:
- If a workflow wastes time → automate it.  
- If a system is unstable → optimize it.  
- If a tool slows me down → replace it.  
- If an idea has potential → build a working version fast.

I’m constantly experimenting, improving, and building things that *don’t* need a whole team to maintain.  
Just smart logic, clever design, and automation doing the heavy lifting.

# 🧠 My Work Philosophy

### **🔹 Automation-first mindset**  
Everything I build starts with a question:  
_“How do we make this run on its own?”_  
Then I design from that angle.

### **🔹 Efficiency over complexity**  
Clean solutions >>> bloated “enterprise” mess.

### **🔹 Build fast, refine continuously**  
The first version ships fast. The next versions evolve intelligently.

### **🔹 Use the right tools, not the loudest tools**  
Quiet tools. Reliable tools. Tools that don’t break.

### **🔹 Free-tier mastery**  
I love pushing limits of platforms most people underestimate.
